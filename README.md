# Java_Library_System
I have successfully developed a software system using Java and JavaFX Scene Builder that allows customers to purchase books, redeem points, view available books, and use points for purchases. Additionally, this system empowers the owner to manage inventory and customers by adding or deleting books and customers using the login credentials.
